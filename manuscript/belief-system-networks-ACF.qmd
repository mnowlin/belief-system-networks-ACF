<!-- **Abstract**: A large body of research has shown that views about climate change are influenced by values and beliefs such as political ideology, partisanship, and cultural worldviews. Such beliefs constrain beliefs about climate change to form a belief system. One prominent way of understanding beliefs and belief systems is that belief systems are hierarchical with core beliefs (such as political ideology and cultural worldviews) that constrain policy domain beliefs (beliefs regarding particular issues and policy domains) and policy attitudes, which are beliefs about particular policies and are constrained by both core and policy domain beliefs. However, recent work has argued that belief systems can be understood as networks of connected beliefs. Using a survey of a nationally representative sample of the US public, I explore the belief system network associated with climate change. Specifically, I examine connections between measures of cultural worldviews (hierarch, egalitarian, individualist, fatalist), ideology, partisanship, the New Ecological Paradigm Scale (NEP), views on climate change (it's happening, it's a risk, and there is a scientific consensus), and support for various climate policies. In addition, I use four network centrality measures including strength, eigenvector, closeness, and betweenness to see which beliefs are the most central in the climate change belief network. I find that cultural worldviews, particularly egalitarianism; support for climate policies, particularly EPA regulations; and the perception of risk associated with climate change are the most central beliefs in the network. -->

# Introduction 

Belief systems are a key element of the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF). Broadly speaking, a belief system is a set of interrelated and connected beliefs. Within the ACF, belief systems bind advocacy coalitions together, provide filters for processing information, and inform policy preferences. According to ACF scholarship, belief systems encompass different types of beliefs in a three-tiered hierarchy where higher-order beliefs influence, or constrain, lower-order beliefs. With the hierarchical approach to belief systems the most abstract beliefs -- termed _deep core_ beliefs -- inform less abstract _policy core_ beliefs, which inform views across a particular policy subsystem as well as _secondary beliefs_, which are beliefs about specific policy approaches or instruments. However, conceptualizing and measuring the various types of beliefs has been difficult. In particular, boundaries between the different types of beliefs tend to be fuzzy, which has lead to inconsistent findings regarding belief systems across ACF studies [@henryAdvocacyCoalitionFramework2022; @nohrstedtAdvocacyCoalitionFramework2023].       

A second way to understand belief systems is as a network of connected beliefs [@boutylineBeliefNetworkAnalysis2017; @brandtWhatCentralPolitical2019; @fishmanChangeWeCan2022; @brandtEvaluatingBeliefSystem2021]. Similar to other types of networks, belief system networks have _nodes_, which are the beliefs, and _edges_ which are the connections, or relationships, between beliefs. Belief system networks can be analyzed using centrality measures to understand the influence of the various beliefs (i.e., nodes). Understanding belief systems as networks in the ACF shifts the focus from the place of the belief(s) in the hierarchy to the centrality of the belief(s) within the network. Focusing on the centrality of beliefs may bring clarity to the role that beliefs play between and across coalitions within a policy subsystem. For example, policy core beliefs are typically considered to be the beliefs that bind coalitions; however, in some policy subsystems secondary beliefs or policy instruments might be what connects policy actors within coalitions [@vossInstrumentConstituenciesSupply2014; @weibleInstrumentConstituenciesAdvocacy2018]. Additionally, recent work has noted that coalitions may form around shared deep core beliefs [@weibleDeepCoreAdvocacy2025]. Also of note is that what distinguishes hierarchical and network approaches to belief systems is that hierarchical approaches posit that influence is based on the type of belief and its position in the hierarchy, whereas in network approaches influence is based on the centrality of the belief within the network.    

<!-- The three most common measures of centrality in a network are betweenness, closeness, and degree (strength). Betweenness centrality calculates how often a node sits on the shortest path between other nodes. Nodes high in betweenness sit between many nodes and act as a gatekeeper. Closeness centrality examines the proximity of a node to other nodes, and is measured by the total number of shortest paths to the node. A node high in closeness is able to rapidly influence a network due to its close proximity to other nodes. Finally, degree centrality measures the number of connections to a node; either in-bound or out-bound connections. In an unweighted network, degree centrality is 0 (not connected) or 1 (connected). Strength centrality is the measure of degree centrality in a weighed network where connections are not either/or but correspond to the strength of the connection.    
-->

To examine how conceptualizing and analyzing belief systems as networks can add to our understanding of belief systems in the ACF, I use original survey data of the US public to examine the belief system network associated with climate change. The theoretical focus of the ACF is coalitions and the belief systems of coalition members (i.e., elite policy actors) operating within and across formal and informal institutions within policy subsystems, rather than the belief systems of the mass public. However, several studies have shown that the belief system structures of elite and public samples are strikingly similar [@herronPerceptionsNuclearSecurity2002; @tumlisonCulturalValuesTrust2019; @jenkins-smithForeignDomesticPolicy2004]. An additional concern is that the belief systems of mass publics tend to be less constrained then those of elites [@kinderNeitherLiberalConservative2017]; however, on polarized issues where elites offer clear cues the mass public hold well-structured beliefs [@levenduskyClearerCuesMore2010]. Therefore, a sample of the mass public, particularly around a highly polarized issue like climate change, provides a valuable "test bed" for understanding the nature and structure of belief systems. 

Apart from adding to our understanding of belief systems in the ACF, examining the climate change beliefs of the public as a network can add insights in the polarized views of the public regarding climate change. There are several explanations for why the public remains divided on the issue of climate change, including political ideology and partisanship; cultural worldviews derived from cultural theory; environmental orientation; acceptance/rejection of the scientific consensus on climate change; and an aversion to government regulations meant to address climate change. Each of the explanations involves beliefs about climate change, yet these beliefs do not exist in isolation from one another, rather they form an interconnected belief system. Indeed, recent work has examined the belief system network of climate change [@leeClimateChangeBelief2024]. This research found that how worried respondents are about climate change was the most central belief in the network. However, apart from political ideology and partisanship, @leeClimateChangeBelief2024 did not include measures of other deep core beliefs such as cultural worldviews and environmental orientation which have been shown to influence climate change beliefs [@jonesLeadingWayCompromise2011; @zieglerPoliticalOrientationEnvironmental2017; @nowlinCulturalTheoryPartisanship2020].

In this paper, I demonstrate the utility of a network approach to belief systems in the ACF. Additionally, by examining the climate change belief network I can determine which beliefs, including political beliefs, cultural worldviews, pro-environmental orientation, views on the scientific consensus, and solution aversion are the most central within the network. Using measures of network centrality including strength, closeness, and betweenness I find that cultural worldviews, specifically egalitarianism (a deep core belief), support for EPA regulations (a secondary belief/policy preference), and perceptions of climate change risk (a policy core belief) are the most central beliefs in the network. However, the centrality of beliefs varied across the different measures of centrality which indicates that the type of belief has various functions in a belief system network. For example, egalitarianism, a cultural worldview and a deep core type of belief, had the highest betweenness and closeness centrality across all respondents meaning that it acted as a bridge connecting other beliefs in the network. Yet, support for EPA regulations, a secondary belief/policy preference had the highest strength centrality meaning that it had the strongest connections (i.e., highest partial corrections with other nodes) in the network. These results point to how the type -- deep, core, secondary -- of belief and the functions of beliefs may vary.   

Next, I examined the belief system networks of two idealized climate coalitions. The two climate coalitions were constructed based on responses to three questions associated with policy core beliefs, including whether or not climate change is happening, the risk associated with climate change, and if there is a scientific consensus about climate change. A _skeptic_ coalition was constructed that consisted of respondents that were less likely, on average, to think climate change is happening, think it is less risky, and do not think there is a scientific consensus regarding climate change. Additionally, I created a _consensus_ coalition that included those that think climate change is happening, is a risk, and there is a scientific consensus. Comparing the climate change belief systems of the skeptic and consensus coalition, I found that for the those in the skeptic coalition views on an international agreement had the highest level of betweenness and closeness centrality and views on are a carbon tax had the highest strength centrality. For the consensus coalition, views on renewable energy had the highest levels of centrality on all three measures. These results point to solution aversion, and secondary beliefs/policy preferences are key factors in belief systems regarding climate change.            

These findings support the importance of deep and policy core beliefs in a belief system network and support the idea that deep core beliefs shape how individuals think about issues like climate change. Additionally, these findings support the importance of secondary beliefs as support/opposition to climate policies and specific policy instruments play a central role within the climate change belief system.  

# Hierarchical Belief Systems and Belief System Networks

Beliefs are propositions that are thought to be true, and the interconnections of beliefs form a belief system. Early work on belief systems by @converseNatureBeliefSystems1964a noted that belief systems consist of a "configuration of ideas and attitudes in which the elements are bound together by some form of constraint or functional interdependence" (3). Constraint or interdependence of idea-elements (i.e., beliefs) within a belief system means that one belief(s) influences other belief(s) and a change in one belief will be associated with a change in another belief. @converseNatureBeliefSystems1964a also noted beliefs can vary by centrality, where a belief that is "central" is less likely to change than a belief that is less central. More recently, @brandtEvaluatingBeliefSystem2021 noted that a theory of belief systems must contain three elements, including a) the components of the belief system must be connected; b) these connections should be causal; and c) contain an accounting of the potential impacts of exogenous factors. 
 

<!-- Finally, belief systems have an organization and structure that is shaped by how beliefs are connected -->

As noted, belief systems are a central feature of the ACF. Early work on the ACF noted that there is a "distribution" of beliefs held by individuals within coalitions and the broader policy subsystem [@jenkins-smithDynamicsPolicyOrientedLearning1993, 42]. The distribution of beliefs form belief systems that have a hierarchical structure where higher-order beliefs, which are abstract beliefs and values, connect to and constrain lower-order beliefs about specific issues [@ripbergerCulturalTheoryMeasurement2014; @nohrstedtAdvocacyCoalitionFramework2023; @sabatierPolicyChangeLearning1993; @jenkins-smithForeignDomesticPolicy2004]. 

At the top of the hierarchy are deep core beliefs such as political ideology or environmental orientation. Deep core beliefs are foundational values that are sufficiently abstract that they can inform views regarding a variety of policy issues. Additionally, deep core beliefs are "central" beliefs in the @converseNatureBeliefSystems1964a sense and, therefore, are resistant to change. While deep core belief have been measured in various ways, increasingly scholars are using the concepts of cultural worldviews developed from cultural theory to conceptualize and measure deep core beliefs within the ACF [@ripbergerCulturalTheoryMeasurement2014; @jenkins-smithBeliefSystemContinuity2014; @hornungPartyIdentificationCultural2021; @sotirovCognitiveTheoryShifting2016; @nohrstedtAdvocacyCoalitionFramework2023]. 

In brief, cultural theory posits four cultural worldviews, or cultural types, which are derived from ideas about how societal relationships should ideally be structured. The four cultural types include _hierarchs_ who value clear lines of authority and rules that guide individual behaviors; _egalitarians_ who value equality and collective well-being; _individualists_ who value autonomy and individual choice; and _fatalists_ who see the world as capricious and outside of human control. An individual's cultural worldview has been shown to inform their views on a host of specific policy issues including national security [@ripbergerHowCulturalOrientations2011]; gun control [@kahanMoreStatisticsLess2003]; trade-offs between rights and security [@jenkins-smithRockHardPlace2009]; immigration [@jacksonTheoryPreferenceFormation2015]; vaccines [@songUnderstandingPublicPerceptions2014]; and climate change [@jonesLeadingWayCompromise2011; @nowlinCulturalTheoryPartisanship2020; @kahanPolarizingImpactScience2012].    

Next are policy core beliefs that involve beliefs about particular policy issues and are typically contained within a policy subsystem. Policy core beliefs contain both a normative and empirical component [@nohrstedtAdvocacyCoalitionFramework2023]. The normative component involves beliefs based on values (e.g., climate change poses the greatest risk to those that are economically vulnerable), and the empirical component includes analytical beliefs about the nature of the problem (e.g., human activity has caused the Earth's average temperature to rise). Deep core beliefs inform policy core beliefs. Additionally, deep core beliefs act as "filters" for how information relevant to a subsystem is processed [@kahanCulturalCognitionConception2012; @nowlinPolicyLearningInformation2021].  

Finally, secondary beliefs involve beliefs about particular policy instruments or coalition strategies. They are the least abstract beliefs in the hierarchy and are informed by both deep core beliefs and policy core beliefs. Secondary beliefs are closely associated with policy preferences, where policy preferences are expressed as support for specific policy instruments [@moysonCognitionPolicyChange2017; @plumerWhenDoesPolicy2024]. For example, believing that a carbon tax would be an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is a secondary belief, and support for a carbon tax based on the belief is a policy preference.    

The hierarchical structure of beliefs include the necessary elements of a theory of belief systems outlined by @brandtEvaluatingBeliefSystem2021 as the belief system components are connected and causality runs from higher-order to lower-order beliefs, or deep core to policy core to secondary beliefs. Additionally, within the ACF exogenous factors such as focusing events or turnover in personnel, among others can change beliefs [@sabatierPolicyChangeLearning1993]. Additionally, a larger number of studies have shown the utility of the hierarchical approach to belief systems; however, some challenges exist. One issue with the hierarchical conceptualization is that the boundaries between different types of beliefs are fuzzy. The distinctions between a deep core belief and a policy core belief or a policy core belief and a secondary belief are not always clear [@henryAdvocacyCoalitionFramework2022]. In addition, each type of belief has been measured in various ways, which has led to different conclusions among scholars regarding belief systems [@ripbergerCulturalTheoryMeasurement2014; @nohrstedtAdvocacyCoalitionFramework2023]. 

Some previous work using the ACF have examined beliefs and identified advocacy coalitions using Discourse Network Analysis (DNA), which combines text analysis and network analysis [@fisherWhereDoesPolitical2013; @leifeldDiscourseNetworkAnalysis2017; @yordyFramingContestsPolicy2019; @fischerDealingBadGuys2016; @kukkonenAdvocacyCoalitionsBeliefs2017]. In general, DNA uses text documents such as newspaper articles or legislative testimonies and identifies statements made by policy actors and codes the statement as being within one (or more) categories such as a belief, frame, or support for a policy proposal. Networks are created based shared coding of statements, and those discourse networks are used to identify coalitions. 

Conceptualizing belief systems as a network provides another way to understand their structure and organization that doesn't rely on hierarchical relationships between different types of beliefs. The network approach builds on both discourse networks and the "beliefs as relations" method of understanding belief systems [see @henryAdvocacyCoalitionFramework2022, 111]. However, these previous approaches are used to identify coalitions by shared belief relations rather than as a way to understand the underlying structure of belief system. In the next section, I argue that conceptualizing and measuring belief systems as networks in the ACF offers can enhance our understanding of how belief systems operate in both individuals and collectives.

Within a belief system network, the components of the belief system -- beliefs -- are understood as _nodes_, and the causal connections between beliefs are _edges_ or _ties_. Understanding belief systems as networks in the ACF offers several advantages over the hierarchical structure, including a) it provides a way to operationalize belief systems consistent with how they are commonly defined; b) allows for the incorporation of different types of beliefs such as deep core, policy core, or secondary; and c) belief system networks can be analyzed using network measures such as centrality to determine which beliefs are prominent or central within the network [@epskampEstimatingPsychologicalNetworks2018; @verschoorExploringRelationshipsClimate2020a; @fishmanChangeWeCan2022; @brandtEvaluatingBeliefSystem2021; @caminaHubsBeliefNetworks2022; @keskinturkOrganizationPoliticalBelief2022; @turner-zwinkelsBeliefSystemNetworks2022]. Additionally, a network approach can complement the hierarchical approach. In particular a network approach can retain the notion of various "types" of beliefs (i.e., deep core, policy core, secondary) but shift the focus from their location in the hierarchy to their centrality, or importance, in a belief system network. The importance of the various types of beliefs may differ across coalitions and subsystems.    

Several studies have illustrated the usefulness of conceptualizing belief systems as networks and many have found that "symbolic" beliefs (e.g., deep core core beliefs such as political ideology) occupy a central role in belief system networks. For example, using the American National Election Study (ANES) @boutylineBeliefNetworkAnalysis2017 found that self-reported political ideology occupies a central role in a network of other beliefs about various policy issues (abortion, environment, guns, death penalty, immigration, inequality, welfare spending). Additionally, using common measures of network centrality @brandtWhatCentralPolitical2019 finds that symbolic beliefs based on identities (political ideology and partisanship) are more central within belief system networks than operational (issues-based) beliefs. 
 
Beliefs that are more central in a belief system network keep an otherwise potentially disparate set of beliefs connected. As noted, modeling belief systems as network means that measures of network centrality can be used to determine which beliefs are central to the network. To explore belief system networks and centrality, I draw from work by @boutylineBeliefNetworkAnalysis2017 who posits a formal belief system network model where: 

> (a) Individuals start with a single central belief ... (b) This central belief is used to produce a number of broad stances ..., which are then used to stochastically produce further beliefs. (c) Newly added sets of beliefs then form the basis for yet newer and more specific beliefs, repeating recursively to yield a center-periphery structure (1378-1379)
 
For example, a central belief, _B_$_0$,  produces two beliefs, _b_$_1$ and _b_$_2$, which in turn begin to generate additional beliefs. Then, additional beliefs are generated through an iterative and recursive process. This is illustrated in @fig-modelNetworks.

![Development of a Belief System Network](networks.pdf){#fig-modelNetworks}

In the first iteration, beliefs _b_$_1$ and _b_$_2$ are derived from belief _B_$_0$ and are highly correlated. In this first iteration, centrality can be calculated as the sum of the absolute pairwise correlations, which @boutylineBeliefNetworkAnalysis2017 terms the _total constraint_ of the belief measures. The belief with the highest value for total constraint is the central belief. As more beliefs are added as illustrated as the second and third iteration in @fig-modelNetworks, the network will start to take on a center-periphery structure. Applying this model to the types of beliefs in the ACF, deep core belief occupy the initial, most central belief. Then, deep core beliefs are used to develop policy core beliefs that are less central. Finally, moving further from the central core are secondary beliefs, which are likely to be on the periphery of the belief network.   

However, it is important to note that inference from one belief to another belief is imperfect and contains exogenous error. Therefore, $\textit{b}_1 = \textit{B}_0 + \Phi_1$ and $\textit{b}_2 = \textit{B}_0 + \Phi_2$, where $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$ represents the error in inference. As the network becomes increasingly complex and starts to develop a center-periphery structure, the total constraint may not show the central belief because the accumulation of error variance, $\Phi_n$, can overpower the central belief variance [@boutylineBeliefNetworkAnalysis2017, 1381]. Therefore, other measures of centrality become important, including _betweenness_ centrality which works to connect beliefs in the core of the network to those in the periphery. Multiple measures of centrality are used to determine the prominence of various beliefs in a belief system network. The most common measures of centrality include _betweenness_ _closeness_, and _degree (strength)_. Each measure of centrality places a distinct emphasis on what makes the node more or less important in the network. 
 
Betweenness centrality measures the degree to which a node sits on the path between other nodes. A node high in betweenness is thought to be important because it reduces the distance between other nodes and, therefore, becomes an important link, or gatekeeper, to other nodes. The betweenness centrality equation for node _n_$_i$ is 

$$
\textit{C}_B (n_i) = \sum_{j<k} \frac{g_{jk}(n_i)}{g_{jk}} 
$$

where _g_$_{jk}$ is the geodesic, or shortest path between nodes _j_ and _k_, and _g_$_{jk}$(_n_$_i$) is the number of shortest paths where _n_$_i$ is present [@quintanaSingleAttitudesBelief2023; @lukeUserGuideNetwork2015]. Beliefs that are high in betweenness centrality work to connect nodes in complex, center-periphery networks [@boutylineBeliefNetworkAnalysis2017].

Closeness centrality refers to how close the nodes are in the network. Nodes that are closer to several other nodes are thought to be influential because the path from them to other nodes is short, which allows the node to more readily influence other nodes through a direct effect. The equation for the closeness centrality of node _n_$_i$ is 

$$
\textit{C}_C (n_i) = \left[\sum_{j=1}^{g}d(n_i,n_j)\right]^{-1}
$$

where _d_ is the distance between nodes. Closeness centrality is the inverse of the sum of distances between _n_$_i$ and the other nodes in the network [@quintanaSingleAttitudesBelief2023; @lukeUserGuideNetwork2015]. A larger value for closeness centrality indicated shorter distances to other nodes, which allows a belief to quickly influence other beliefs.  

Degree centrality measures the number of direct connections to a node, and more connections is indicative of the prominence and importance of the node. Strength centrality is associated with degree centrality, as degree centrality is used in unweighted networks, strength centrality is used in weighted networks. Specifically, strength centrality is calculated as the sum of the weights, rather than the sum of the connections as in degree centrality. This means that nodes with high strength centrality are well connected with other nodes. 

In the following analysis, I examine the climate change belief system network of the mass public in the US. Next, I briefly describe several drivers of climate change views among the public.   

# Climate Change Beliefs

Even as climate scientists agree that climate change is happening, is anthropogenic, and poses significant risks, opinions are divided on each of those questions among some elites and some of the mass public. Several factors have been shown to influence beliefs about climate change including deep core beliefs such as partisanship, ideology, cultural worldviews, environmental attitudes, as well as policy core beliefs including views about the scientific consensus, and secondary beliefs associated with aversions to the solutions presented to address climate change. 

Perhaps the clearest divides regarding climate change are connected to political beliefs. Several studies have shown that within the mass public in the US conservatives and Republicans are less likely than liberals and Democrats to think that climate change is happening or that it poses a risk [@bugdenDenialDistrustExplaining2022;  @mccrightPoliticizationClimateChange2011;  @bohrPublicViewsDangers2014; @mildenbergerSpatialDistributionRepublican2017]. Evidence suggests that polarization among the mass public is driven by elite polarization, as the public takes cues about policy and political issues from the political figures and news sources that they trust [@brulleShiftingPublicOpinion2012; @carmichaelEliteCuesMedia2017; @krosnickOriginsConsequencesDemocratic2006; @merkleyPartyCuesNews2021; @merkleyPartyElitesManufactured2018; @teslerEliteDominationPublic2018]. 

Apart from political beliefs, cultural worldviews derived from cultural theory have also been associated with climate beliefs. Early theorizing of cultural theory noted that the various cultural worldviews hold different myths of nature that drive how they see the natural environment and the risks posed to it [@thompsonCulturalTheory1990]. In brief, egalitarians tend to view nature as fragile and ephemeral, whereas individualists see nature as robust. Hierarchs tend to see nature as tolerant within limits that need to be carefully and expertly managed. Finally, fatalists see nature as random and unpredictable and therefore impossible for humans to manage [@grendstadCulturalMythsHuman2000]. The various myths of nature associated with cultural worldviews likely drive climate beliefs. Research has found that egalitarians are the most concerned about climate change, and individualists are the least concerned among the cultural types [@jonesLeadingWayCompromise2011; @verweijClumsySolutionsComplex2006; @kahanCulturalCognitionScientific2011; @kahanPolarizingImpactScience2012]. Hierarchs tend to occupy a "middle" space between egalitarians and individualists on environmental issues broadly [@ripbergerCulturalTheoryMeasurement2014] and climate change specifically [@nowlinCulturalTheoryPartisanship2020]. Finally, given their views about the capriciousness of nature, fatalists don't tend to have clearly defined beliefs regarding climate change [@jonesLeadingWayCompromise2011; @nowlinCulturalTheoryPartisanship2020]. 
 
Broader environmental values and attitudes also shape views on climate change. One of the most commonly used measures of environmental orientation is the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale [@dunlapNewEnvironmentalParadigm2008; @sternNewEcologicalParadigm1995; @sparksMeasuringEnvironmentalValues2021]. In brief, the NEP scale measures "beliefs about humanity’s ability to upset the balance of nature, the existence of limits to growth for human societies, and humanity’s right to rule over the rest of nature" [@dunlapNewTrendsMeasuring2000, 427]. Using the NEP scale, a pro-environmental orientation is associated with concerns about the robustness of nature and the impacts of human activities on the natural world. Previous research has found that a pro-environmental orientation, as measured by the NEP scale, is associated with views about climate change [@nowlinEnvironmentalPolicymakingEra2019; @zieglerPoliticalOrientationEnvironmental2017].

As noted, opinions differ on climate change in spite of the clear scientific consensus. A series of studies have found that acceptance of the scientific consensus around climate change acts as a "gateway belief" that connects to beliefs that climate change is happening and also connects to support for actions to address climate change [@goldbergExperienceConsensusVideo2019; @vanderlindenGatewayBeliefModel2019; @vanderlindenScientificConsensusClimate2015]. Using experimental research designs, scholars have found that those exposed to a message about the scientific consensus were more likely than those not exposed to a consensus message to change their beliefs regarding climate change (i.e., it's happening, it's anthropogenic, and it's a risk) as well as increase their support for public action [@vanderlindenGatewayBeliefModel2021a]. 

Political beliefs are a leading source of division regarding climate change, and one explanation for the influence of political beliefs for both elites and the mass public is solution aversion [@campbellSolutionAversionRelation2014]. One of the underlying differences between Republicans/conservatives and Democrats/liberals is how they see the role of government, particularly the federal government, in addressing societal problems. Generally speaking, Republicans/conservatives are more skeptical of the government's ability to address problems than Democrats/liberals. Much of the discussion around climate change involves government actions to address it, and when government action is presented as a solution it is likely to trigger skepticism among Republicans/conservatives, which leads to broader skepticism about the problem. In essence, the solution aversion hypothesis posits that secondary beliefs and/or policy preferences are drivers of broader views of policy issues.  

A recent study used a network approach to examine climate change beliefs and found that how worried respondents are about climate change, a policy core belief, was the most central belief in the climate change belief network [@leeClimateChangeBelief2024]. Additionally, support for regulating greenhouse gas emissions (secondary belief/policy preference) and beliefs about potential harm resulting from climate change (policy core belief) also scored high on measures of network centrality. While this study provided important insights into the climate change belief system of the US public, it did not include measures of many deep core beliefs shown to be important influences of climate change beliefs, including cultural worldviews and environmental orientation. In the next section, I discuss the various measures that will be used in the following belief system network analysis. 

# Data and Analysis 

To examine the belief system network around climate change, I use original public survey data collected in October of 2017. The data comes from a representative sample of about 1200 residents of the US obtained through Survey Sampling International (SSI), and the survey was administered online through Qualtrics. Respondents were asked questions regarding their views on climate change, support for policy approaches to address climate change, agreement with statements from the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP), questions to determine their cultural worldview based on cultural theory as well as their ideological and partisan attachments. 

## Belief Measures 

Cultural theory, political ideology, partisanship, and the NEP scale were used to measure survey respondents' deep core beliefs. Questions regarding the belief and certainty that climate change is happening; the risk posed by climate change; and whether or not a scientific consensus exists about climate change were used to measure the policy core beliefs of respondents'. Finally, policy preferences, including support for several policy approaches to address climate change including a carbon tax, cap-and-trade, EPA regulations, international agreements, geoengineering, and nuclear energy were used to measure secondary beliefs. I describe each of the measures below.^[Summary statistics are shown in the appendix, @tbl-descript.]  

For cultural worldview measures, I rely on a standard set of survey questions used in many previous studies [e.g., @jacksonTheoryPreferenceFormation2015; @jonesLeadingWayCompromise2011; @moyerCulturalPredispositionsSpecific2019; @nowlinCulturalTheoryPartisanship2020; @tumlisonCulturalValuesTrust2019], which have been demonstrated to have convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity [@swedlowConstructValidityCultural2020]. Specifically, respondents rated their agreement, on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) scale, with 12 statements presented in random order. Of the 12 statements, three represented each of the four cultural types. The statements for each cultural worldview are presented below.  

The statements for the hierarchy worldview included: 

> - _The best way to get ahead in life is to work hard to do what you are told to do_
> - _Society is in trouble because people do not obey those in authority_ 
> - _Society would be much better off if we imposed strict and swift punishment on those who break the rules_ 

For egalitarianism the statements included: 

> - _What society needs is a fairness revolution to make the distribution of goods more equal_
> - _Society works best if power is shared equally_
> - _It is our responsibility to reduce differences in income between the rich and the poor_ 

The individualism statements were:  

> - _Even if some people are at a disadvantage, it is best for society to let people succeed or fail on their own_
> - _Even the disadvantaged should have to make their own way in the world_
> - _We are all better off when we compete as individuals_

Finally, the fatalism statements included: 

> - _The most important things that take place in life happen by chance_
> - _No matter how hard we try, the course of our lives is largely determined by forces beyond our control_
> - _For the most part, succeeding in life is a matter of chance_

For purposes of analysis, I combined and averaged the three statements into a 1 to 7 scale for each worldview, with a higher number indicating increased agreement with the statements associated with that cultural type. The hierarchy scale has a mean (_M_) of `r round(mean(beliefData$hier, na.rm=TRUE),2)` and a standard deviation (_sd_) of `r round(sd(beliefData$hier, na.rm=TRUE),2)`. In terms of reliability, the hierarchy scale has a Cronbach's $\alpha$ = `r round(hierA$alpha,2)`. The egalitarianism scale has a _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$egal, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, _sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$egal, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, and a Cronbach's $\alpha$ = `r round(egalA$alpha,2)`. For the individualism scale, the _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$indiv, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, _sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$indiv, na.rm=TRUE),2)` and the Cronbach's $\alpha$ = `r round(indivA$alpha,2)`. Finally, the fatalism scale has a _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$fatal, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, _sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$fatal, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, and a Cronbach's $\alpha$ = `r round(fatalA$alpha,2)`. Overall, the Cronbach's $\alpha$ values show sufficient reliability for each of the cultural worldview scales.

To measure political ideology, I asked respondents to self-identify on a 1 to 7 scale with 1 = strongly liberal,4 = middle of the road, and 7 = strongly conservative. The ideology scale has a _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$ideology, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, and a _sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$ideology, na.rm=TRUE),2)`. For partisanship I asked respondents with which party those most identified, followed by how strongly they identify with that party. I combined the two questions into a 1 to 7 scale with 1 = strong Democrat, 4 = true independent, and 7 = strong Republican. Partisanship has a _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$partisan, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, and a _sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$partisan, na.rm=TRUE),2)`.

> - **ideology**: _On a scale of political ideology, individuals can be arranged from strongly liberal to strongly conservative. Which of the following best describes your views?_
> - **partisan**: _With which political party do you most identify? Do you completely, somewhat, or slightly identify with that party?_ 

To examine deep core beliefs related to the environment, I used three "pro-environment" statements from the NEP scale. As with the cultural worldview measures, respondents were asked to rate their agreement with the three statements on a 1 to 7 scale and responses were averaged together for a single 1 to 7 scale. The combined scale has a _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$nepScale, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, _sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$nepScale, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, and a Cronbach's $\alpha$ = `r round(nepA$alpha,2)`. The statements are listed below, and they were randomized on the survey.  

> - **New Ecological Paradigm Scale**:
>     - _The balance of nature is very delicate and easily upset_
>     - _Humans live on a planet with very limited room and resources_
>     - _Humans are seriously abusing the environment_ 

For the policy core belief measures related to climate change I examined whether respondents believe that climate change is happening (yes or no), and how sure they are that it is/is not happening (0 = Not at all sure, 1 = Somewhat sure, 2 = Very sure, 3 = Extremely sure). The questions, stated below, were combined into a nine-point scale with -4 indicating that respondents are _extremely sure_ that climate change is _not_ happening to 4 indicating that respondents are _extremely sure_ that climate change _is_ happening. The _happening_ measure has a _M_= `r round(mean(beliefData$happening, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, and a _sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$happening, na.rm=TRUE),2)`. 

In addition, respondents we asked about their perception of risks associated with climate change on a 0 (no risk) to 10 (extreme risk) scale, and the _risk_ measure has a _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$risk, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, and a _sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$risk, na.rm=TRUE),2)`. Finally, I asked respondents their perceptions of the scientific consensus surrounding climate change. The _sciconsensus_ measure is dichotomous and has a _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$sciconsensus, na.rm=TRUE),2)` (_sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$sciconsensus, na.rm=TRUE),2)`), which indicates that `r round(mean(beliefData$sciconsensus, na.rm=TRUE),2)*100` percent of respondents believe that there is a scientific consensus regarding climate change. Exact question wordings and variable labels are below.

> - **happening**: _Do you think that climate change is happening? How sure are you that climate change [is/is not] happening?_ 
> - **risk**: _On the scale from zero to ten, where 0 means no risk and 10 means extreme risk, how much risk do you think climate change poses for people and the environment?_
> - **sciconsensus**: _Most scientists think climate change is happening_^[The exact wording for the scientific consensus question was: Which of the following statements comes closest to your view? 1 – Most scientists think climate change is happening, 2 – There is disagreement among scientists, 3 – Most scientists think climate change is not happening, 4 – Don’t know. I then created the `sciconsensus` dummy variable with 1 = Most scientists think climate change is happening, and 0 = all other responses.]

Finally, for secondary beliefs/policy preferences I measured support for various policy approaches using a 1, strongly oppose to 7, strongly support scale. Policies were presented in random order.

> _Various policy solutions have been proposed as ways for the federal government in the United States to deal with climate change. Using a one to seven scale, where 1 is strongly oppose and 7 is strongly support, please indicate your support for each of the following policy proposals._

> - **IntAgree**: _Accept internationally-established limits on U.S. production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases thought to cause climate change_
> - **Renew**: _Encourage research and development of renewable energy sources like solar or wind power_
> - **Nuclear**: _Expand the use of nuclear energy_
> - **Tax**: _A carbon tax that imposes a charge on coal, oil, and natural gas in proportion to the carbon they contain_
> - **EPA**: _Environmental Protection Agency regulations that limit the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that power plants can emit_
> - **CapTrade**: _A cap and trade program that sets an overall cap on emissions through allowances that can be bought, sold, or saved for future use_
> - **GeoEng**: _Encourage development of "geoengineering" technology such as filters that remove excess carbon dioxide from the air and high-altitude orbiting reflectors to reduce solar heating_ 

Overall, renewable energy has the highest mean at `r round(mean(beliefData$Renew, na.rm=TRUE),2)` (_sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$Renew, na.rm=TRUE),2)`). The next highest level of support is for US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations at _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$EPA, na.rm=TRUE),2)` (_sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$EPA, na.rm=TRUE),2)`), followed by geoengineering at _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$GeoEng, na.rm=TRUE),2)` (_sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$GeoEng, na.rm=TRUE),2)`), and support for an international agreement at _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$IntAgree, na.rm=TRUE),2)` (_sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$IntAgree, na.rm=TRUE),2)`). For the two market-based approaches, support for a carbon tax has a _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$Tax, na.rm=TRUE),2)` (_sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$Tax, na.rm=TRUE),2)`), and support for cap-and-trade is _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$CapTrade, na.rm=TRUE),2)` (_sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$CapTrade, na.rm=TRUE),2)`). Finally, support for expanding nuclear energy has the lowest level of support at _M_ = `r round(mean(beliefData$Nuclear, na.rm=TRUE),2)` (_sd_ = `r round(sd(beliefData$Nuclear, na.rm=TRUE),2)`).     

## Belief System Network Analysis 

Examining belief systems as a network involve the same types of assumptions and analysis that is involved with examining other types of networks such as social or informational networks. A network is composed of nodes (e.g., groups, individuals, information, beliefs) and edges, or ties that connect the various nodes. Additionally, networks can be directed, where the connections are only in one direction (**A** $\rightarrow$ **B**), or undirected with reciprocal relationships (**A** $\leftrightarrow$ **B**). Networks can also be unweighted, where the edge takes on a binary value (i.e., a connection is present or not) or weighted, where the edge is assigned a value. In a belief system network the nodes are observed variables and the edges are statistical relationships between the nodes [@epskampEstimatingPsychologicalNetworks2018]. In addition, they are often weighted networks and the values assigned to the edges are based on the strength -- the partial correlation coefficient -- of the relationship between the nodes. Finally, belief system networks are typically exploratory and therefore often assumed to be undirected [@costantiniStateARtPersonality2015].   

In the following analysis, I estimate the climate change belief system network using a Gaussian graphical model (GGM), which is a type of pairwise Markov random field (PMRF) model and is commonly used in the examination of psychological networks [@epskampBriefReportEstimating2017]. With a GGM the edges of the network are partial correlation coefficients, which estimate the association between nodes controlling for the other nodes in the network. The input for the GGM is a covariance matrix, but the network model is based on the inverse of the covariance matrix, which produces the partial correlation estimates [@epskampTutorialRegularizedPartial2018]. Polychoric correlation is used when the data contain ordinal variables. The model is a weighted network and weighted by the strength of the partial correlations. The model is then regularized using the "least absolute shrinkage and selection operator" (LASSO), which reduces the possibility of spurious correlations by reducing small coefficients to essentially zero [@brandtWhatCentralPolitical2019; @friedmanSparseInverseCovariance2008]. This approach is common in psychological network analysis because of the small sample size relative to the data needed to estimate network models [@epskampTutorialRegularizedPartial2018]. The LASSO requires a tuning parameter for regularization to manage the sparsity of the network. A common approach is to use an information criteria to select the appropriate parameter such as the extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC), which provides additional penalties for model complexity [@epskampBriefReportEstimating2017; @foygelExtendedBayesianInformation2010]. To estimate and illustrate the network I use the `bootnet` and `qgraph` packages in `R` [@epskampQgraphNetworkVisualizations2012; @epskampBootnetBootstrapMethods2023].

The measures of centrality -- betweenness, closeness, and strength -- in the belief system network were calculated through a bootstrapping procedure using 1000 resamples of the data. The procedure was performed in `R` using the `bootnet` package [See @epskampBootnetBootstrapMethods2023; @epskampTutorialRegularizedPartial2018]. The results of the bootstrap method show the estimated centrality as well as the 95% confidence interval for each measure including betweenness, closeness, and strength.  

In the following analysis, I first examine the climate change belief network which includes deep core beliefs (cultural worldviews, ideology, partisanship, NEP scale), policy core beliefs (climate change is happening, climate change risk, scientific consensus), and secondary beliefs/policy preference (support for various policy measures). Next, I explore betweenness, closeness, and strength centrality measures of the nodes in the climate change belief network to see which beliefs are the most central. Then, I use differences on the policy core beliefs to construct two climate coalitions; a "skeptic" coalition and a "consensus" coalition. Next, I examine the centrality of beliefs in the two coalitions. Finally, I use network comparasion tests to explore the differences in belief networks between the two climate change coalitions.  

# Results

The results for the climate change belief network are shown in @fig-beliefNetNetwork. The results depicted in @fig-beliefNetNetwork shows deep core beliefs in black, policy core beliefs in gray, and secondary beliefs/policy preferences in white. Additionally, positive partial correlations between nodes are a solid line and negative partial correlations are dashed lines. Finally, the network is weighted and the strength of the partial correlations are illustrated by the thickness of the edges, with thicker paths illustrating stronger correlations.

Overall, the network has 17 nodes and 89 (of 136) non-zero edges, or connections. Looking at the network overall, it seems that the cultural worldview measures are clustered together, the political belief measures are also clustered, the NEP scale is clustered with the policy core measures (i.e., climate change beliefs), and the secondary beliefs/policy preferences (i.e., climate policy measures) are clustered together with the exception of nuclear energy. The directions of the relationships in the network are as expected with deep core beliefs associated with climate beliefs and both are associated with support for the various climate policies. Finally, some of the stronger associations in the network are between partisanship (more Republican) and ideology (more conservative); beliefs that climate change is happening is strongly associated with beliefs about the scientific consensus as well as beliefs about the risks of climate change; the various policy measures (aside from nuclear energy) are also highly correlated, particularly support for renewable energy and geoengineering; and the cultural worldviews of hierarchy and individualism as well as egalitarian and fatalism are highly correlated. After visualizing the network, I next examine various measures of centrality within the network. The results of bootstrap procedure estimating the centrality measures and the 95% confidence intervals are shown in @fig-cent.

![Measures of Network Centrality](centralPlots.png){#fig-cent}

Looking first to betweenness centrality, as shown in @fig-cent, egalitarianism is the node with the highest betweenness centrality, by a wide margin with `r round(betw_centO$mean[1], 2)`. Next is climate change risk perceptions at `r round(betw_centO$mean[2], 2)` followed by closely by fatalism at `r round(betw_centO$mean[3], 2)`, and individualism with `r round(betw_centO$mean[4], 2)`. Nodes high in betweenness sit on the shortest path between the other nodes in the network and act as a bridge between other beliefs. 

Also shown in @fig-cent, egalitarianism has the highest closeness centrality with `r round(close_centO$mean[1], 5)`, followed by support for an international agreement to address climate change at `r round(close_centO$mean[2], 5)`. Beliefs high in closeness are more closely connected to other nodes, so they have the shortest path to other nodes, which allows them to be influential in the network. 

Finally, looking to strength centrality, support for EPA regulations has the highest degree of strength centrality followed by perceptions of risk posed by climate change, and then support for an international agreement to address climate change. Strength centrality reflects the sum, using absolute values, of weighted connections. The EPA node has the highest degree of strength centrality among the nodes in the network with `r round(str_centO$mean[1], 2)`. Of note, the highest partial correlation coefficients for the EPA node included the policy variables international agreement at _r_ = `r round(beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet[11,15], 3)`, carbon tax at _r_ = `r round(beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet[14,15], 3)`, and renewable energy at _r_ = `r round(beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet[12,15], 3)`, as well as the NEP scale at _r_ = 0.13. The support for an international agreement had a strength centrality of `r round(str_centO$mean[2], 2)` and, similar to EPA regulations its strongest partial correlations were with the other policy measures including EPA regulations (`r round(beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet[15,11], 3)`), a carbon tax (`r round(beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet[14,11], 3)`), cap-and-trade (`r round(beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet[16,11], 3)`), and geoengineering (`r round(beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet[17,11], 3)`) as well as policy domain belief of climate change risk (`r round(beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet[9,11], 3)`) and the core belief of egalitarianism (`r round(beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet[1,11], 3)`). Finally, climate change risk node had a strength centrality of `r round(str_centO$mean[3], 3)`. It was most highly correlated with the other policy domain beliefs including that climate change is happening and that there is a scientific consensus regarding climate change. 

Next, I examine belief networks of two climate change coalitions by using the policy core measures. Policy core measures were used to construct the coalitions because the ACF posits that policy core beliefs are what bind coalitions together [@nohrstedtAdvocacyCoalitionFramework2023].

To illustrate two possible climate change coalitions, I use the policy core belief measures of climate change, including whether its happening and certainty that it is/is not happening; perceived risk of climate change; and whether or not there is a scientific consensus regarding climate change. Specifically, I constructed a _skeptic_ climate change coalition consisting of those in the first quantile of the climate change is happening measure (<= 2 on the -4 to 4 scale), the first quantile of the risk posed by climate change measures (<= 5 on the 0 to 10 scale), and those that thought there is not a science consensus regarding climate change. Next, I constructed a  _consensus_ coalition consisting of those in the third quantile of the climate change is happening (a 4 on the -4 to 4 scale) and climate change risk distribution (>= 9 on the 0 to 10 scale) as well as those that believe there is a scientific consensus. Overall, there were `r nrow(lowRiskData)` respondents in the skeptic coalition and `r nrow(highRiskData)` respondents in the consensus coalition. @tbl-beliefs shows the differences of means in deep core and secondary beliefs between the two coalitions.

: Deep Core and Secondary Belief Comparisons Between the Climate Change Coalitions {#tbl-beliefs}


As shown in @tbl-beliefs, the consensus coalition is more egalitarian, more fatalist, more concerned about the environment, more liberal, and more Democratic than the skeptic coalition. However, there are not significant differences between the coalitions on hierarchy and individualism. Additionally, the consensus coalition is more supportive of all the climate policy measures than the skeptic coalition with the exception of nuclear energy. Yet, some of the policy measures are more polarized than others. Support for an international agreement is the most polarized with a difference of `r round(mean(highRiskData$IntAgree, na.rm=TRUE)-mean(lowRiskData$IntAgree, na.rm=TRUE),3)` on the seven-point scale. The next most polarized was a carbon tax with a difference of `r round(mean(highRiskData$Tax, na.rm=TRUE)-mean(lowRiskData$Tax, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, followed by EPA regulations with a difference of `r round(mean(highRiskData$EPA, na.rm=TRUE)-mean(lowRiskData$EPA, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, cap-and-trade at `r round(mean(highRiskData$CapTrade, na.rm=TRUE)-mean(lowRiskData$CapTrade, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, and geoengineering at `r round(mean(highRiskData$GeoEng, na.rm=TRUE)-mean(lowRiskData$GeoEng, na.rm=TRUE),2)`. The least polarized policy was expanding renew energy at a difference of `r round(mean(highRiskData$Renew, na.rm=TRUE)-mean(lowRiskData$Renew, na.rm=TRUE),2)`. Finally, there were no significant differences between the coalitions on support for nuclear energy.  

Next, I examine the structure of the belief networks of the skeptic and consensus coalitions, and the results are in @fig-gc. The belief network of the skeptic coalition is shown in @fig-lr and the network of the consensus coalition is shown in @fig-hr. As before, deep core belief nodes are black and the secondary beliefs/policy preferences nodes are white. Additionally, I used bootstrapping to estimate the centrality measures of each network. The centrality measures are shown in @fig-cc, with the skeptic coalition in @fig-lrC and the consensus coalition in @fig-hrC.^[Note that the confidence intervals for the centrality measures of the coalitions are wide because of the small sample size.]

Network Centrality Measures by Climate Change Coalition
:::


The skeptic coalition network shown in @fig-lr has 14 nodes and 39 (of 91) non-zero edges, and the consensus coalition, shown in @fig-hr, has 14 nodes and 50 (of 91) non-zero edges. Overall, the skeptic coalition has fewer connections between beliefs than the consensus coalition. 

Next, I examine the measures of centrality for the two networks. For the skeptic coalition, as can be seen in @fig-lrC,  the international agreement measure had the highest betweenness and closeness centrality while the carbon tax measure has the highest strength centrality. The centrality of support for an international agreement on climate change in the skeptic coalition follows from the finding the debate over the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 in the US was a major contributor to the polarization of climate change [see @krosnickImpactFall19972000]. Additionally, support for a carbon tax, egalitarianism, and political ideology are the other beliefs highest in betweenness and closeness centrality. For strength centrality, support for EPA regulations is also among the top four. For the consensus coalition, shown in @fig-hrC, renewable energy support followed by support for EPA regulations had the highest level of betweenness, closeness, and strength centrality. 

To look for significant differences between the skeptic and consensus networks, I use a Network Comparison Test (NCT) to examine differences in the structure, connectivity, and node centrality of the belief system networks of the two coalitions [@vanborkuloNetworkComparisonTestStatisticalComparison2023]. The NCT involves three steps: 1) estimating the networks using the observed data and calculating the value of a test statistic, 2) create a "reference distribution" by pooling and randomly resampling the observed data, estimate the networks using the resampled data, and calculate a test statistic, and 3) evaluate the significance of the test statistics when the _p_-value, which "equals the proportion of resampled test statistics that is at least as extreme as the observed test statistic"  [@vanborkuloComparingNetworkStructures2023, 1275].  
 
Using NCT, I first perform an invariant network structure test, which examines whether the edges of the belief system networks of the skeptic and consensus coalitions are the same. This test uses an omnibus approach to test differences in all the edges of the networks. The null hypothesis is that all of the edges are equal across the two networks. The test statistic is _M_, or _maximum_, which "provides the largest value (in absolute terms) among each element of a vector" [@vanborkuloComparingNetworkStructures2023, 1277]. In this analysis, the vector contains the differences of the unique edge weights of the pre-and-post networks. The null hypothesis is that all the differences between the edge weights of the networks are 0. Based on the NCT analyses, the structure of the networks are similar since M = 0.231, _p_=0.530.

Next, I use NCT to test for invariant global strength, or the overall level of connectivity, between the networks. Global strength is the "weighted absolute sum of all edges in the network" [@vanborkuloComparingNetworkStructures2023, 1277], and the test statistic is _S_, which is the difference in global strength between the two networks. The null hypothesis is that the level of connectivity is equal in the two networks or that _S_ = 0. The global strength for the skeptic network is 5.953, and for the consensus network it is 6.710. This indicates that the skeptic network is less connected than the consensus network, and this difference is significant with _S_ = 0.756, _p_ = 0.094.  

Finally, I examined differences in the three centrality measures across the two networks. For betweenness centrality, ideology and support for geoengineering had significant higher degrees of centrality at _p_<0.05 in the skeptic coalition than the consensus coalition. There were four nodes, of all which were deep core beliefs, that were significantly different between the two network on closeness centrality, including ideology and partisanship, which were higher in the skeptic coalition as well as fatalism and the NEP scale, which were higher in the consensus coalition. For strength centrality, hierarchy, NEP scale, and support for nuclear energy had higher degrees of strength centrality in the consensus coalition than the skeptic coalition, whereas, support for a carbon tax had higher strength centrality in the skeptic coalition. 

# Discussion 

Central to the ACF is the idea of belief systems, and within the ACF belief systems are posited to exist in a hierarchy where higher-order deep core beliefs influence lower-order policy core beliefs and secondary beliefs. Another way of understanding the structures of belief systems is as a network where beliefs are the nodes and connections between beliefs are the edges. With a hierarchical approach to belief systems, the location of the belief in the hierarchy is what needs to be identified because the influence of the belief within the system is based on its being a higher-order belief within the hierarchy. For example, deep core beliefs constrain secondary beliefs, but secondary beliefs are not expected to influence deep core beliefs. With a network approach, the structure of the belief system is a result of how the beliefs are connected and what needs to be identified is which belief(s) are most central in the network. Beliefs higher in centrality are more influential.    

In this paper, I used original survey data from a representative sample of the US public to examine the belief system network associated with climate change. By conceptualizing and measuring climate beliefs as a network I was able to demonstrate the utility of a network approach to conceptualize beliefs systems in the ACF. A major strength of this approach is that it measures the role and importance of various beliefs based on centrality rather than the more limiting approach to the roles that beliefs can play in a hierarchical approach. Of note, I found that the beliefs that were most central, depending on the centrality measure, included deep core, policy core, and secondary beliefs. Additionally, I examined the centrality of beliefs across two constructed climate change coalitions and found that secondary beliefs and egalitarianism were the most central in both coalitions. Finally, the results matched several expectations from the literature on public opinion and climate change regarding the importance of different types of beliefs within the climate change belief network. 

Looking at the centrality measures overall, cultural worldviews, support for various policy approaches, and perceptions of the risks posed by climate change were the most central types of beliefs in the network. These findings provide support for the expectations regarding deep core beliefs, particularly cultural worldviews, as well as the expectations of solution aversion. However, less support is found for the scientific consensus as a gateway belief expectation as agreement with the scientific consensus did not have a high level of centrality across any of the measures. In particular, if the scientific consensus was a "gateway belief" it would have likely had a high level of betweenness centrality; however, the cultural worldview of egalitarianism had the highest level of betweenness followed by climate change risk, fatalism, and individualism. Further, the perceptions of risks associated with climate change was the most central policy core belief across multiple measures, rather than the scientific consensus. These findings are consistent with previous research that found that worry about climate change was the most central belief [@leeClimateChangeBelief2024]. Next, I look to the results of the various centrality measures, beginning with betweenness and closeness centrality. 

For the measures of closeness and betweenness centrality, egalitarianism was the most central node in the climate change belief network. Closeness and betweenness centrality both address the lengths of the paths between nodes, with closeness meaning that a node influences other nodes because of its short path and betweenness meaning that a node is influential because it sits on the path between other nodes. Beliefs high in closeness and betweenness act as gateways to other beliefs. These findings are consistent with the notion of cultural worldviews being deep core beliefs that influence other beliefs. Egalitarianism in particular has been shown to be associated with environmental and climate change views [@ellisSeeingGreenCultural1997; @grendstadCulturalTheoryPostmaterialism1997; @jonesLeadingWayCompromise2011; @nowlinCulturalTheoryPartisanship2020; @xueCulturalWorldviewsEnvironmental2014; @nowlinWhoShouldMore2022]. Additionally, the centrality finding of egalitarianism is also consistent with cultural cognition, where cultural worldviews shape not only _what_ people think but also _how_ people think and process information about political and policy concerns [@kahanCulturalCognitionConception2012; @kahanCulturalCognitionScientific2011; @kahanPolarizingImpactScience2012; @nowlinEnvironmentalPolicymakingEra2019]. Finally, as shown in @fig-beliefNetNetwork the egalitarian node is in the most central location in the network.   


As noted, strength centrality is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the weighted edges and the sum could reflect either the node with the strongest correlations and/or the node with the highest number of edges. As shown in @fig-cent, the EPA node has the highest strength centrality followed by the climate change risk node, and finally the international agreement node. For the EPA node, its strength measure was a result of several strong correlations, whereas the strength of the risk node was a result of having the highest number of edges. 

<!-- Eigenvector centrality examines the strength of each node as well as the strength of the nodes to which the node is connected. The EPA node and the international agreement node had roughly the same eigenvector value, which indicates that they are connected to other nodes with a high strength centrality. This is do, in part, to the fact that many of the various policy measures are connected to each other as well as other nodes with high strength centrality such as climate change risk and egalitarianism. Looking at both strength and eigenvector centrality, the same five beliefs were the most central including the policy views of EPA regulations, international agreement, and a carbon tax, as well as the policy domain belief of climate change risk, and finally, the cultural worldview of egalitarianism. The centrality of the policy nodes provides some evidence of the solution aversion expectation as these results point to the importance of the policy measures within the climate change belief network. -->


In brief, the skeptic coalition is less certain that climate change is happening, believes there is less risk associated with climate change, and does think there is a scientific consensus regarding climate change.

While the results provide support for the expectations regarding the importance of various beliefs within the climate change belief network, there are several avenues for future research. Of note, is how the various climate policy measures are highly correlated with the exception of nuclear energy, which was only weakly positively correlated with support for cap-and-trade and a carbon tax, and weakly negatively correlated with support for renewable energy. However, support for nuclear energy was strongly positively correlated with individualism and weakly positively correlated with fatalism. This follows other research that has shown that views about nuclear energy are not associated with concern about climate change even though nuclear energy is a low carbon energy source [@hawesClimateSciencePolitics2022; @ter-mkrtchyanPortionsPortfoliosUnderstanding2022; @feldmanClimateChangePolarizing2018]. 

Additionally, examining the climate change belief networks of various subgroups should be explored. For example, @caminaHubsBeliefNetworks2022 found that the structure of belief system networks varied across different subgroups including liberals and conservatives; younger and older; and male and female. The results shown here illustrate the centrality of beliefs across the entire sample; however, it is possible that some subgroups (e.g., egalitarians and individualists) have different belief networks with different beliefs being more (or less) central than the aggregate. 

Methods such as community detection algorithms could be used to identify coalitions within an entire belief system network [@quintanaSingleAttitudesBelief2023]. 

Future research should also explore the degree to which the climate change belief network may be dynamic and the implications of that dynamism. The results presented here are cross-sectional; however, @fishmanChangeWeCan2022 showed that over the course of the 2008 presidential campaign in the US the political belief network of high knowledge respondents increased in density (i.e., strength of associations), whereas the density of low knowledge respondents remained static. These findings suggest that, for some, belief networks may change over time, which could mean that connections strengthen over time, as shown in @fishmanChangeWeCan2022, or perhaps that connections may change as beliefs not previously associated with each other become linked. Examining climate beliefs as a network provides insights into which beliefs are central, which means that a change in those beliefs could impact the network as whole, thus altering how climate change is understood.       

Belief systems of individuals versus collectives ... belief systems are thought to exist within individuals; however, network approaches measure the belief systems of collectives ... @fishmanChangeWeCan2022 found that the centrality of beliefs was not associated with their predictive capabilities, likely because of the disconnect between individual and collective belief systems ... however, traditionally the ACF referred to the "distribution of beliefs" within subsystems  


<!-- The politically polarizing nature of climate change is a result of the various beliefs that individuals, both the elite and the mass public, hold about climate change. Previous research has found that various cultural worldviews, political beliefs, views of the environment, views of climate change, and support/opposition to various policy proposals drive the divisions. In this paper, I examined the ways in which these views and beliefs are connected in a network and which of the beliefs regarding climate change are central to the network. -->
